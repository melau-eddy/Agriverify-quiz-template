Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are created through biotechnology techniques that allow scientists to alter an organism's DNA. Key scientific aspects:

1. Process:
- Identification of desired trait (e.g., pest resistance)
- Isolation of responsible gene
- Gene insertion using gene guns or bacterial vectors
- Testing and selection of successful modifications

2. Common Modifications:
- Bt crops: Produce insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis
- Herbicide-tolerant crops: Resist glyphosate or glufosinate
- Drought-resistant varieties: Express genes for water retention
- Nutritionally-enhanced crops: Like Golden Rice with beta-carotene

3. Safety:
- FDA, EPA, and USDA evaluate GMO safety
- 2000+ studies show approved GMOs are safe
- No documented cases of harm from consumption

Common GMO Myths Debunked:

1. "GMOs cause cancer":
- Fact: No credible evidence. 280+ studies confirm safety.

2. "GMOs are unnatural":
- Fact: Genetic modification occurs naturally (e.g., sweet potatoes contain Agrobacterium genes)

3. "GMOs harm butterflies":
- Fact: Bt crops reduced insecticide use by 56%. Monarch decline is primarily due to habitat loss.

4. "Farmers get sued over accidental contamination":
- Fact: Zero documented cases. Myth stems from organic seed patent cases.

5. "GMOs don't increase yields":
- Fact: Bt cotton increased Indian yields by 24-50%. Drought-tolerant corn shows 15-25% better yields in dry years.

6. "GMOs cause allergies":
- Fact: All GMOs are tested for allergenicity. No new allergies from approved GMOs.

Scientific Consensus:
- 280+ institutions worldwide affirm GMO safety
- Equivalent to conventional foods in risk
